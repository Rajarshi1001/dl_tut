# DL_models
- This is a basic ann created for the fashion_mnist dataset provided by tensorflow.keras.
  The Accuracy of the model is on a moderate level since I'm still learning about the different methods to boost the performance of a model.
  This model unfortunately doesn't use any regularizations :| .
- This also contains ANN for the CIFAR_10 dataset(yes I should have used a CNN), the accuracy is decent enough.
- Also included a Xcception model based on transfer learning method already implemented in keras, the accuracy needs to be improved though :/ since the overall            dataset is a bit small.
- I have also trianed an artificial Neural network on an Audio Dataset by passing the MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients to the ANN Model for audio classifcation.
