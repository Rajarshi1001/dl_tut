# dl_models
This is a basic ann created for the fashion_mnist dataset provided by tensorflow.keras.
The Accuracy of the model is on a moderate level since I'm still learning about the different methods to boost the performance of a model.
This model unfortunately doesn't use any regularizations :|
This also contains ann for the CIFAR_10 dataset(yes I should have used a cnn), the accuracy is decent enough.
I have also included a simple transfer learning model created using Xception directly from keras, the accuracy needs to be improved though :/ since the dataset is a bit small.
